**Advanced Computational Condensed Matter Project**

*Juan José Rodríguez Aldavero*

Infinite Time Evolving Block Decimation toy project done for the Advanced Computational Condensed Matter project done at the University of Amsterdam.

This project how a tensor network algorithm, written from scratch in Python, can be used to compute the energies of the Transverse-Field Ising spin chain, a paradigmatic quantum system.

Project based on the tutorials found at https://www.tensors.net/mps
